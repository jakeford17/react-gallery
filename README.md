# React Gallery
The React Gallery was my first project that used React. The project consists of a gallery page full of photos from Boston Sports Championships. Visitors can click on an image to see a description (team and year) and use a button to "like" an image.

## Installation
* `npm install`
* In separate Terminal tabs `npm run client` and `npm run server`
* The database is not used for this project--all the photos are stored in `gallery.router.js`
* Because we're using `nodemon`, both our client side and server side will automatically spin back up when changes are made

## Technologies Used
React Gallery used the following technologies: React, Node.js, Express.js, Passport, and CSS for styling.

## Acknowledgement
I'd like to thank Prime Digital Academy and my classmates in the Porta cohort for their help and support with this project.
